                <p class="info-abt-stadium">The stadium takes its name
                    from 'bayt al sha'ar' - which were tents
                    historically used by nomadic peoples in Qatar and the Gulf region. <br> <br>

                    The design honours Qatar's past and present, while keeping one eye on the future of the community.
                    <br>

                    Covering an area larger than 30 football pitches, Al Bayt Park boasts vast green spaces with play
                    areas and exercise stations, along with tracks for running, cycling, horse riding and camel riding.
                    <br> <br>

                    In addition, the precinct is home to multi-sport grounds which are also open for public use. In
                    November 2021, the Quodorat Centre, a community space for the preservation of cultural heritage and
                    inter-generational dialogue, opened its new headquarters within the precinct, in partnership with
                    the SC and Aspire Zone. <br> <br>

                    Led by Qatar's Ministry of Culture and Sport, a branch of the Nomas Centre will teach youth about
                    the country's cultural heritage by organising a number of activities, including horse riding. <br>

                    Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium stands proudly in Umm Al Afaei- one of Qatar's most historic cities and home
                    to the famous Al Rayyan SC. It is located right on the edge of the desert, the scene of many Qatari
                    tales that live close to the hearts of the locals - a welcoming people who love their football as
                    much as their fascinating past. <br>
                    The stadium's design, and that of its surrounding buildings, mirrors aspects of the local culture
                    and traditions. The intricate façade reflects the undulations of sand dunes while intricate
                    geometric patterns reflect the beauty of the desert, native flora and fauna, as well as local and
                    international trade. It is the perfect home for Al Rayyan SC when the tournament ends. <br>
                    More than 80% of the construction material came from the original stadium that previously occupied
                    the site, while existing trees were also carefully retained. When fans visit, they will be able to
                    travel via an environmentally friendly new Doha Metro system - complementing a truly sustainable
                    venue experience. <br>

                    Lusail Stadium hosted the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™ Final - an event that secured its place in

                    a wonder, built to lie in harmony with its surroundings. <br>
                    The design reflects the hand-crafted bowls found all across the Arab and Islamic world during the
                    rise of civilisation, while interplays of light mirror the fanar lanterns of the region. With the
                    passing of time, the golden exterior will fade replicating aged metal handicrafts to create a venue
                    alive with cultural character. <br>
                    On 18 December 2022, 88,000+ fans came together here for the greatest FIFA World Cup™ Final ever.
                    Afterwards, and in keeping with Qatar's dedication to sustainable development, Lusail Stadium will
                    be transformed into a community space of schools, shops, cafés, sporting facilities and health
                    clinics. This is the amazing we've all been waiting for - the here, the now and the future. <br>

                <p class="info-abt-stadium">
                    Stadium 974 made history even before its first match. Constructed entirely from shipping containers
                    and modular steel, it is the first fully demountable covered football stadium - showing Qatar's
                    commitment to cost-effective sustainability and daring design. <br>
                    After the tournament, the containers and super-structure will be reused. A waterfront development
                    boasting fabulous facilities for the local community will spring to life, as well as a dynamic hub
                    for business. This new concept in venue development ensures that while Stadium 974's physical
                    presence may be temporary, its legacy will be everlasting. <br>

                    Education City Stadium is an extraordinary venue. It shines a brilliant light on Qatar's position as
                    a dynamic learning hub for students and academics across the Arab World and beyond. Its namesake
                    location, Education City, is a vibrant centre of learning and knowledge. The arena is empowered by
                    its neighbouring universities whose corridors buzz with new ideas and stories of cutting-edge
                    research - expressing visionary talent and innovation. <br>
                    Around the campuses, you'll discover many first-in-class sporting and leisure facilities. After the
                    tournament, more amenities will be added to the stadium precinct - keeping locals and the academic

                    Al Janoub Stadium lies in the southern city of Al Wakrah, one of Qatar's oldest continuously
                    inhabited areas. A city rich in history but with its sights set on a new horizon - the future of
                    football. As the FIFA World Cup 2022™ plays out, the world will be invited into some of the most
                    unique stadiums ever built for the beautiful game - Al Janoub Stadium sits firmly in that
                    category. <br>
                    After the tournament, Al Janoub's capacity will be reduced, with seats donated to other sporting
                    projects around the world. This will also guarantee an electric atmosphere for Al Wakrah SC
                    matches. Beyond football, the venue's is surrounded by luscious parkland featuring sport and
                    leisure facilities which will benefit the whole community for years to come. The future is
                    bright for this wonderful arena. <br>
