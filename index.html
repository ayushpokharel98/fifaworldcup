        <p id="intro">The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is an international association football
            competition contested by the senior men's national teams of the members of the Fédération Internationale de
            Football Association (FIFA, the International Federation of Association Football), the sport's global
            governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930,
            except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War. The reigning champions are
            France, who won their second title at the 2018 tournament in Russia.
            <br>
            The format involves a qualification phase, which takes place over the preceding three years, to determine
            which teams qualify for the tournament phase. In the tournament phase, 32 teams compete for the title at
            venues within the host nation(s) over about a month. The host nation(s) automatically qualify.

        <center><span>Detailed Information about 2022 World Cup</span></center>
        <p id="this-wc"> This time world was held in Qatar. According to the football fans, this was the best worldcup
            ever because all of the matches were very interesting and unpredictable. Unexpected things happened like
            noone thought Morocco will progress so far and so on. Well, after 64 matches, a record 172 goals, one of the
            best (and most evenly priced) finals in history and the prior 12 years of existential footballing crisis,
            the Qatar 2022 World Cup finally reached its crescendo. In many ways, the footballing gods treated us to a
            fairytale like no other. Lionel Messi, the best to ever lace the cleats, lifted the one prize that always
            seemed to allude to him and extinguished any doubt that he sits alone in the pantheon of football greatness.
            Although you get the inkling, Kylian Mbappe will give his title a challenge in the coming years after
            pushing the 'little magician' all the way on the greatest stage.
            <br>
            The FINAL match was the most interesting one. It was Argentina vs France (Messi vs Mbappe). Argentina won it
            but France also played it well. Argentina led 2-0 at half-time through goals from Lionel Messi and Ángel Di
            María, but Kylian Mbappé equalised for France by scoring two goals in the space of two minutes in the second
            half. During extra time, Messi scored an additional goal and Mbappé scored a third goal which left the match
            tied 3-3. Argentina won the ensuing penalty shoot-out 4-2 to earn their third World Cup, and first since
            1986.
